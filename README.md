robusta hiring task

Issues faced in this Task:
- API had a fixed calling limit by day which restricated developing the features.
- Remembering Objective-c syntax took a couple of hours.
- Total amount of working hours on this task is from 5 - 7 hours.
- Didn't have enough time to write unit test nor use correct git flow instead of just committing all in one branch (main branch).
